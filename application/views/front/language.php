	SMP Islam Al Azhar 13 Surabaya has Islamic and international environment which is obvious from the using of Al Azhar Curriculum and Cambridge Assessment International Education Curriculum in teaching and learning.  
We emphasize on an integrated and balanced human development --intellectual, physical, spiritual, moral, emotional and social-- based on the Islamic World View anchored on Tawhid (the unity of God).  This means spiritual and character education is regarded as equally important as intellectual education.  We arouse curiosity and wonder in our students, we inculcate important values such as religious, entrepreneur, aware of environment and learning spirit.  We enhance our students’ spirituality through wonders of the natural phenomena, congregational prayers, Qur’an recitation and memorization, Islamic studies, as well as observe and practice Islamic adab. 
We desire our students to be excellent in whatever they do following the precept of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh).  Thus, the School encourages and trains them to think creatively, collaboratively and ethically with project based learning through Al-Azhar Curriculum for Muslim Development, National and Cambridge Assessment International Education so that they will be able to make good judgement in their life skills independently.  They are also encouraged to excel in their academic and co-curricular activities.

<br> <br>
	<h4 style="color: #5492f7" ><b>Digital Learning Platform Yukblajar</b></h4>
	SMP Islam Al Azhar 13 maintains a 1 : 1 student to computer ratio.  Our academic curriculum encourages a computer based learning with digital learning platform ‘YukBlajar’.  As such, almost every subject has research-based projects to ensure that students become computer-literate, and are able to use e-resources effectively.  
	<br> <br>
	<h4 style="color: #5492f7" ><b>'.$SS.'</b></h4>
	Currently, SMP Islam Al Azhar 13 Surabaya has an enrollment of approximately 169 students from Grade 7 to Grade 9. All of our students are Muslims.  Undoubtedly there are many international schools in the country, but SMP Islam Al Azhar 13 Surabaya befitting its name pay particular attention to students overall development especially in inculcating good discipline, moral values and character based on Islamic values.  This concern is reflected in our students’ spiritual activities.  We regard these extra-curricular and pastoral activities as vital as our academic activities especially in character building, leadership skills, thinking skills, self confidence and self efficacy.
